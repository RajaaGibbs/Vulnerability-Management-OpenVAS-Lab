# Vulnerability-Management-OpenVAS-Lab
I set up our Vulnerability Management Scanner using OpenVAS in the Azure marketplace. After deploying it with a basic VM configuration, I logged in, changed default credentials, and created a vulnerable VM. Then, I configured and performed unauthenticated and credentialed scans, followed by remediation.
